        <p>With nearly 500 students, PennApps continued to hold its title as the top college hackathon. With Venmo, Dropbox, Microsoft, Andreessen Horowitz, and many other companies sponsoring, PennApps Spring 2013 was able to attract students from universities as far off as California (Stanford, Berkeley, etc.), Canada (Waterloo, Toronto) and even Switzerland (ETH Zurich), becoming the first PennApps to go international. First place went to <a href='https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/pennapps-spring-2013/hacks/inventory'>Inventory</a> and the rest of the winners can be found <a href='http://2013s.pennapps.com/prizes/'>here</a>.</p>

        <p>With over 300 students, we more than doubled in size. Sponsored by Venmo, Bain Capital Ventures, KPCB, and many more, PennApps 2012 Fall managed to churn out a future member of the YC '13 class, <a href='http://paytango.com'>PayTango</a>. Despite fierce competition, <a href='http://www.pennapps.jocelinlee.com/#&panel1-1'>Java Auto Music</a> won first place with the <a href='http://blog.pennapps.com/post/31797542186/pennapps-winners'>rest of the winners</a> being just as impressive.</p>

        <p>Sponsored by Venmo, Coursekit (now Lore), Tumblr, Yahoo, and nineteen other companies, PennApps Spring 2012 centered around the theme of simplicity. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m33PqhdDl0M&feature=plcp&context=C38b45d6UDOEgsToPDskIpt5vtYUlhubu8UT-6LMdj">ScratchTable</a> won the grand prize: the team used a contact mike and their coding skills to turn any surface into a DJ turntable. Second place was <a href="http://grassroutes.us/">Grassroutes</a>, a hack that allowed anyone to put a widget on any website, giving users one-click access to their congressional representatives.

        <h1><a href="http://2011f.pennapps.com/">PennApps 2011 Fall</a></h1>
        <p>In Fall 2011, the focus was data. Sponsored by Venmo, Comcast, Twilio, Yahoo, Palantir, Tumblr, Mozilla, and 30 other companies and organizations, we challenged students to choose from a variety of publicly available data sets. Competitors were asked to uniquely and efficiently solve problems through the use of data. 40 teams presented at the demo session, and <a href="http://teams.2011f.pennapps.com/">their hacks</a> were truely innovative as were <a href='http://2011f.pennapps.com/blog/2011/9/18/congratulations-to-the-winners.html'>the winners</a>.</p>

        <p>This was the first 48 hour PennApps; though only 10 teams made it through, we think they did an amazing job! One standout app was <a href="http://www.septanow.org/">SEPTA Now</a>, which tracks SEPTA regional trains around the city so users can know exactly where trains are, and if they're running late.</p>
